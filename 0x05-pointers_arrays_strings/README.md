This file contains a description of all the files in this project.
The files in this project deal with the use of arrays and pointers in C.

A function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value
it points to to 98.

## 1-swap.c

A function that swaps the values of two integers.

## 2-strlen.c

A function that returns the length of a string.

## 3-puts.c

A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

## 4-print_rev.c

A function that prints a string in reverse, followed by a new line.

## 5-rev_string.c

A function that reverses a string.

## 6-puts2.c

A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the

## 7-puts_half.c

A function that prints only the second half of a string, followed by a new line.
if the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n
characters of the string where n = (length of string - 1) / 2.

## 8-print_array.c

A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new
line. The nunmbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space and should
be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.

## 9-strcpy.c

The function takes into account all the '-' and '+' that occur before the first
set of integers. if there are no numbers in the string the function returns a 0,
else it returns the converted integer.

## 101-keygen.c
